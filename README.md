# Experiment: Vue-based character sheet for Shadowrun 6

This is partly to brush up on my Vue.js-fu as well as to actually build
a character sheet that isn't tied into some proprietary platform that
doesn't work right half of the time.

It's still in a very(!) early stage, so don't get your hopes up yet.
